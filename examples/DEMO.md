# A short ExamLoop session

This is an authored walkthrough using invented course material and student answers. It illustrates the intended behavior; it is not a transcript of an independent student test. No real student records or past exam text are included.

## 1. Start with a small outline

**Student**

> Help me prepare for my Intro Data Analysis midterm. Our outline covers filtering, grouping, mutate, summarize, and proportions. No joins or hypothesis tests. The exam has code blanks and multi-select questions. Here is an instructor review example: "After grouping four rows into two groups, does mutate return two rows or four?" We can bring one typed double-sided sheet.

**ExamLoop**

> Welcome to ExamLoop. We'll use your course scope, independent attempts, feedback, and new practice to build your review guide. You can ask for a hint at any point; I'll keep solutions separate until you ask and save a learning record when file access is available.

> Your confirmed scope is filtering, grouping, mutate, summarize, and proportions. Joins and hypothesis tests are excluded. The review example supports practicing grouped row counts, but one example is too small to establish the instructor's overall topic distribution. I'll start with one short diagnostic. We can draft your reference sheet later using the confirmed two-side allowance.

> The data contain four rows: A has counts 2 and 6; B has counts 3 and 9. After grouping by category and using `mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))`, how many rows remain, and what are the four proportions?

## 2. Give a hint without the result

**Student**

> A small hint, please.

**ExamLoop**

> Ask two separate questions: does this operation keep the existing rows, and which rows belong in each denominator? Use the total within the current category.

## 3. Diagnose and preserve the attempt

**Student**

> Two rows. I think the proportions are 2/20, 6/20, 3/20, 9/20.

**ExamLoop**

> Your answer: "Two rows; 2/20, 6/20, 3/20, 9/20."

> Feedback: `mutate()` keeps the four rows and adds a column. Because the data are grouped, the denominator is 8 within A and 12 within B. The proportions are 0.25, 0.75, 0.25, and 0.75. This is a reasoned, manually checked solution; the R snippet has not been executed in this walkthrough.

> Your answer used a whole-table denominator and treated `mutate()` as if it collapsed groups. I'll record these as two concepts to practice and use a different context next.

Illustrative record after feedback:

| Concept | Status | Evidence | Corrective rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Grouped proportions | Needs practice | Reviewed wrong denominator, after a hint | Choose the denominator from the active group |
| mutate versus summarize | Needs practice | Reviewed row-count error | mutate preserves rows; summarize with scalar summaries returns one row per group |

## 4. Test transfer

**ExamLoop**

> A survey contains Yes and No counts for each residence: North has 4 Yes and 6 No; South has 9 Yes and 3 No. You want one row per residence showing the Yes proportion. Explain how you would combine the counts, and give the two proportions. You may answer in words without writing code.

**Student**

> I would summarize within each residence, taking Yes divided by Yes plus No. North is 0.4 and South is 0.75. There should be two rows.

**ExamLoop**

> Correct. You used a group-specific denominator and chose a summary because the result needs one row per residence. I'll mark both concepts Improving: this is one correct independent transfer attempt after the earlier error. Another independent application would provide stronger evidence.

Illustrative attempt history:

| Attempt | Outcome | Assistance | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Grouped mutate diagnostic | Incorrect | One hint | Reasoned solution |
| Residence summary transfer | Correct explanation and calculation | None on this item | Reasoned solution |

## 5. Continue later

**Student**

> Continue from this learning record.

**ExamLoop**

> The record shows improving performance on group denominators and row counts. I'll start with a multi-select item that combines filtering with grouping. Joins and hypothesis tests remain excluded. After your attempt, we can add the most useful distinction to your two-sided study sheet.

In actual use, the assistant should report the real path where the profile and record were saved. This document does not create a student workspace, claim a save occurred, or provide a rendered reference sheet.
