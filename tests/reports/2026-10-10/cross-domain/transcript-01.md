**Hi student, let's get you uncooked.**

Welcome to GPT, I'm Cooked. We'll use your notes → your attempt → feedback → saved learning evidence. The greeting marks this tutoring workflow; it does not indicate context capacity.

**CS-MINI:** Your `count = 2` is incorrect; **count = 3**.

| Body execution | x before | x after | count after |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 8 | 4 | 1 |
| 2 | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 2 | 1 | 3 |

The first incorrect step is excluding the third execution. The condition is checked **before** the body: with `x = 2`, `x > 1` is true, so both the division and `count++` run. Only the next condition check, with `x = 1`, stops the loop. **Verified computation:** I executed a trace implementing the supplied integer-division rule. Source: [notes](materials.md), CS-MINI / C1.

For complexity, C1 explicitly excludes it and supplies no teaching rules. The [GPT, I'm Cooked skill](../../../../plugins/exam-loop/skills/gpt-im-cooked/SKILL.md) says, “When teaching notes are missing, state the gap and request the relevant excerpt”; please provide that excerpt so I can explain it from your course content. This is a source gap, not a student error.

**AST-MINI:** “Mars actually reverses its orbit” is incorrect. Retrograde is **apparent westward motion against the background stars**. In the supplied account, Earth's passing an outer planet changes the viewing geometry; the planet does not reverse its orbital direction.

Keep the two descriptions separate: **apparent motion tells you how Mars appears against the stars; orbital direction tells you how it travels in its orbit.** The apparent motion can be retrograde while its orbital direction stays the same. **Reasoned solution:** [notes](materials.md), AST-MINI / A1.

I saved your original reasoning, both reviewed misconceptions, and your self-reported difficulty with the astronomy distinction in separate records:

- [CS-MINI learning record](study/cs-mini/exam-unspecified/learning-record.md)
- [AST-MINI learning record](study/ast-mini/exam-unspecified/learning-record.md)

Both concepts remain “Needs practice”; seeing a correction does not yet demonstrate improvement. No extra practice is included. The next step is to resolve the complexity source gap; rechecks can wait until you request them.
